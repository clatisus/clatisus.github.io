I'm currently a software engineer at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), interested in distributed systems, coding competitions ([codeforces account](https://codeforces.com/profile/Deng1X)), and programming languages. 

A big fan of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Kotlin](https://www.kotlinlang.org). Write [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/) and [C++](https://isocpp.org/) occasionally.
